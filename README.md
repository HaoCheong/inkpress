If these files already exists, run the following command

```bash
inkpress
```

## Template Creations

Templates are basic text files with tags denoted by the `{{ tag }}` in the text file. Each tags must match a selection of option key in the options file. Otherwise an error is thrown. The template is written in `/workspace/template.txt`

Below are table of a tags and special tags denoted by an underscore `_tag` that each have unique properties

| Tags           | Descriptions                                                      |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{{ tag }}`     | Simple tag, will match to the same key as seen in the options.yml |
| `{{ \_time }}`   | Returns the current time                                          |
| `{{ \_manual }}` | Forces a manual input                                             |

Tags can also be given options flags along with certain values depending on the input. Some flags will not have any affect on certain special tags.

| Options                      | Descriptions                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `{{ tag -r }}`                 | Randomly select from the options provided by the tag                                                                                                                                             |
| `{{ tag -l <count> <delim> }}` | Allow you to loop the same options by a specific count and deliminated by a specifc deliminator (limited to one character or newline character). For infinite looping, use a negative number for the count. Select DONE to terminate the looping |

## Options Writing

Options are the selection which is tag is associated with.

For example:

```yaml

# options.yml file
greeting:
  - "Yo!"
  - "Hello, "
  - "Howdy"

affect:
  - "tired?"
  - "thirsty?"
  - "sick of the establishment?"
```

```
# template.txt file

{{ greeting }}, lemme guess you are {{ affect }}
```

You can add new option tags as well as selections for each tag.
